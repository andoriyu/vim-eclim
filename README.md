Made this to simply prevent the need to have `.vim/eclim` and `.vim/eclim.vim` in
the vim directory.

As long as eclimd is running, this should install all you need with any plugin manager.

Vundle:
```
Plugin/NeoBundle/Plug 'starcraftman/vim-eclim'
```

Then install using whatever command, for Vundle: `:PluginInstall`

No Warranty.
